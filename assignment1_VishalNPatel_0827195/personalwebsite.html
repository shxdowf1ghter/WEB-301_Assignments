    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>Greetings! I'm Vishal N Patel, currently pursuing my studies at St. Clair College in Web Development and Internet Application. 
        Originally hailing from India, I embarked on this Canadian journey for my diploma right after completing high school. My current
         aspirations are twofold: first and foremost, achieving independence, and secondly, venturing into the entrepreneurial world 
         by establishing my own restaurant. I am enthusiastic about the diverse opportunities that lie ahead and am keen to combine my 
         educational background with my passion for culinary endeavors. Looking forward to the exciting journey ahead!</p>

    <p>Firstly, photography is my creative outlet, capturing moments that tell unique stories. Secondly, I'm a culinary enthusiast, 
        exploring diverse cuisines and nurturing my dream of owning a restaurant. Lastly, I'm passionate about staying active through 
        regular workouts, finding balance and strength in physical activity. Excited about the journey ahead, where tech meets 
        creativity, culinary adventures unfold, and the gym becomes my sanctuary!</p>

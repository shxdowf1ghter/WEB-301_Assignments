            <p>I Had my final assignment in the previous semester and I was challenging and it was great too. Although I didnt got enough 
                marks but it was fun doing that assignment. We were asked to create a twitter login page and few sliding famous profiles beneath the 
                login section. And I was not able to find image of that web project but I do have the image of few codes. And I have given rough image
                how my project looks like!!!
